Examples of Machine Learning Algorithns

 This project will work with FIFA 19 data set available from the link below on Kaggle and aim to use 
 some machine learning algorithms to predict soccer player market value based on player's attributes.
 This study is for learning purposes only, as it contains stats from the video game series from EA, 
 and not real world information about the athletes. Nevertheless, the information available is reliable 
 and useful to achieve the goals of this project.

 Note: to run this project successfuly you'll first need to download the dataset from the link below 
 and place the unziped file under 'data' directory
