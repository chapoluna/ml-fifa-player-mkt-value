# This project will work with FIFA 19 data set available from the link below on Kaggle and aim to predict 
# soccer player market value based on player's attributes.
# Althought this data set contains stats from the video game series from EA, reliable and useful information  
# for the purpose of this course which is to train a machine learning algorithm.

# FIFA 19 complete player dataset
